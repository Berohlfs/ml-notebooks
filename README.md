# AI Roadmap

Learning AI with notes and python notebooks!

## Prerequisites

If you wish to execute the notebooks on your machine, you need to setup your Python environment:

1. Install Python on your machine using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
    * `uv` works for both Unix-based systems and Windows. In my opinion, it is the go-to package manager for Python projects, and it can also manage your Python versions. 
    * Watch this [uv tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgSQr0d5EVg&t=38s).
    * **I wouldn't recommend installing Python globally**.
    * If you're on Mac or Linux, you could install `pyenv` as your Python version manager, and use `uv` only as a package manager. 
2. Test your environment [here](./notebooks/src/welcome.ipynb).
